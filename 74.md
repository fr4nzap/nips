Trust attestations
------------------

`draft` `optional`

The Nostr social graph is derived from [NIP-02](02.md) follow lists. While this acts as a proxy for a Web of Trust, follows do not imply trust.

Trust is hereby defined as the confident reliance on the authenticity, integrity and non-harmful nature of an individual, irrespective of their abilities or expertise. This NIP introduces kind `2003` to attest trust in such an individual.

Context for this attestation, like abilities of the individual, can optionally be expressed through [NIP-32](32.md) self-reporting. Clients are encouraged to utilize complex algorithms and publically available information to derive structured and actionable data about this pubkey's trust profile.

The event MUST contain exactly one `p` tag with the trusted pubkey, and zero or more `l`/`L` tags as per NIP-32.

A `revoke` tag with a value of `false` at a later `created_at` timestamp will undo any previous attestation to this pubkey.

```json
{
  "kind": 2003,
  "tags": [
    ["p", "<pubkey>", "<optional recommended relay URL>"],
    ["L", "org.schema"],
    ["l", "Plumber", "org.schema"],
    // ["revoke", false]
  ],
  // ...
}
```
